1. The purpose of this app is to create/edit/delete events and event categories
2. Currently the app is able to do all CRUD operations and store them into a database with a working user interface.
3. Future improvements for this app include creating a Person class in order for users to login to their accounts and create and manage events as weel as create a profile to interact with other users' events.
 The Person class should include the following fields: id (int), name (String), username (String), email (String), password (String) and the following
   methods: getters and setters for all fields and just a getter for id
 No additional classes would be needed
 Person Class and Events class would have a many to many relationship
